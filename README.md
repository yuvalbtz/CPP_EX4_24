# K-ary Tree Implementation

## Overview

This project implements a template-based k-ary tree in C++. The k-ary tree is a generalization of a binary tree where each node can have up to `k` children. The project includes several types of iterators for traversing the tree, as well as a method to visualize the tree using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). Additionally, a `Complex` class is provided to demonstrate the use of custom objects within the tree.
